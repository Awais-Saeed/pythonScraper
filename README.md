# About This Repo

Hi, welcome to my Python Scraping repository. 
In this repo, I will upload Python scripts that cover several aspects of data extraction, such as handling infinite scrolls, uploading images from your computer, and more. I will also try to upload full-fledged scripts for sraping data from certain sites. 

### ⚠️ Attention ⚠️
Changes in the website's DOM structure can result in errors when you run the scripts. Ensure that the element is accessible by updating the path to it.
